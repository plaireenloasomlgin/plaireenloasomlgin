Single-payment loans continue to be issued in 27 states, and lenders have tended to maintain them as the dominant product offering in states where it is legal to do so. For instance, they are the most common type of payday loan offered in 22 of those states and the only one offered in 13 of them. (See Figure 1.) In nine of those 22 states, lenders also offer payday installment loans or high-rate lines of credit, but they typically issue fewer of those than of single-payment loans. For example, from July 2020 to June 2021, Florida lenders originated approximately 3 million single-payment payday loans, but just 600,000 payday installment loans.12

In addition, seven states have laws that effectively limit maximum loan amounts to less than $500. Although these states also have lower borrowing costs, that is often a result only of the small loan sizes rather than actual lower prices compared with states that permit loans of $500 or higher. Most of these seven states have annual percentage rates (APRs) over 200%, with single-payment loans as the most common payday product.

Lenders generally charge borrowers higher rates on single-payment payday loans than on installment ones even when both are allowed under state law. In Idaho, for instance, lenders charge an average APR of 652% (25% per pay period) for a single-payment $500 payday loan. As a result, borrowing the same $500 repeatedly over four months will cost $1,000 in fees, nearly double the $532 that borrowers pay for a comparable installment loan offered by the same group of lenders.
