Researchers from Pew reviewed available state regulatory reports on loans issued by payday lenders to determine the most common types of payday loans in each state. (See Figure A.1.) For states that have not published relevant data in the past three years, Pew reviewed advertised product options and pricing information from the six largest payday loan chains in the U.S. and used that information to calculate dollar costs and annual percentage rates. In states that limit loan sizes to less than $500, dollar costs are based on the largest loan size allowed.

In APR calculations of single-payment payday loans, the modal term, 14 days, is used. The dollar costs calculated for a four-month loan term equal eight pay cycles, or 112 days. (See Table A.1.) In APR and cost calculations of payday installment loans, monthly payments are based on a four-month loan term.
