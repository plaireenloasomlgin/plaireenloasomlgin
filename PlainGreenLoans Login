Installment repayment structures are not, by themselves, sufficient to protect borrowers. A robust set of consumer protections is required to deliver better payday loans. In states that have enacted comprehensive payday loan reforms, installment loans are safer and more affordable, but, elsewhere, payday installment loans usually carry excessive prices, prolonged terms, and unaffordable payments. Borrowers in states without adequate regulatory safeguards pay only a small fraction of principal in each monthly installment and APRs in the 200s, 300s, or even higher. (See Figure 2.) Pew’s prior research has found that typical payday loan borrowers can afford payments equal to approximately 5% of their income or $125 a month, but high-cost installment loans often require payments that exceed $200—and even $300—a month.13

This model can produce long-term debt at high costs, similar to single-payment payday lending.14 For example, lenders in Delaware, Missouri, Texas, and Wisconsin charge annual rates of more than 300% for payday installment products. According to state regulatory data, a $500, four-month installment loan in Texas costs $645 in finance charges at an APR of 527%, with the borrower ultimately repaying $1,145.
